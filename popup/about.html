    <h1>url - patcher</h1>
    <p>
        The idea to having a browser extension to patch urls quickly was made by a former colleague of mine.<br/>
        Since we had to test a webpage on multiple environment, we always found nearly the same url, but with a
        little
        difference.<br/>
        It was always annoying to change the url manually in the browser - especially if the url was more than a
        "bit"
        different.<br/>
        I encouraged him to write this extension, but he did not find the time to do it.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now I found it. It was somewhere hidden in last friday, yesterday and today I still find some of it.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I hope this extension helps others to find a smoother workflow.

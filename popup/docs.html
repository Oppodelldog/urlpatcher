    <h1>url - patcher docs</h1>
    <div id="toc"></div>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The idea of url patcher is trivial, you define adjustments that shall be done to the current url by a single
        click.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Here's an example:</strong><br/>
        Your website is published in multiple countries, for every country your domain has the appropriate suffix
        (<strong>.com,
        .co.uk, etc</strong>)<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Precondition to use url-patcher:</strong><br/>
        You are annoyed by clicking in the url field and change the suffix manually.<br/>
        <br/>
        This is the use case url-patcher was made for.<br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>How to use url-patcher:</strong><br/>
        Define an <strong>action</strong> which will execute one or more <strong>replacements</strong> on the url.<br/>

    </p>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        By default this extension creates a <strong>sample configuration</strong> with some advanced setup.
        It is intended to help understanding the usage and setup of this extension.<br/><br/>

        The configuration consists of the following sections:<br/>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Actions</li>
        <li>Transformation Chains</li>
        <li>Test URLs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Actions</h3>
    <p>
        A action is what you will click on to apply url transformations and load the new url in the active tab.<br/>
        To separate actions with different concerns actions are grouped in the configuration.<br/>
        In the example below you find a <strong>action group</strong> named <strong>language</strong>.
        <br/>
        The group itself contains the concrete action names <strong>co.uk</strong> and <strong>de</strong><br/>
        These names are represented in url-patchers <a href="popup.html">Actions Page</a> and define the buttons you can
        click to change the
        url.<br/>
        <br/>
        Every action consists of the following fields:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>chain</li>
        <li>args</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Chain</h4>
    <p>Refers to the Transformation Chain that will be applied</p>
    <h4>Args</h4>
    <p>Contains the arguments that are passed to every transformation in the chain.</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <pre>
      "actions": {
        "language": {
          "co.uk": {
            "chain": "language",
            "args": ["co.uk"]
          },
          "de": {
            "chain": "language",
            "args": ["de"]
          }
        }
      }
    </pre>
    <h3>Transformation Chains</h3>
    <p>
        In a transformation chain you define one or multiple transformations that shall be applied to the url.<br/>
        <br/>
        The <strong>transformations</strong> section in JSON is represented by a JSON object, so transformation chains
        are
        represented by the <strong>field names</strong> of that object.<br/>
        In the example below you find one transformation chain named <strong>environment</strong>.<br/>
        The name is used to connect the transformation chain with a concrete action.

    </p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <pre>
    "transformations": {
        "environment": [
          {
            "transform": { /* ... */ },
            "chainArgs": {
              "breakIfNotFound": false,
              "breakIfFound": true
            }
          },
        ]
    }
    </pre>

    <h4>Chain Args</h4>
    <p>
        Having multiple transformations may require to control the chain to stop under certain conditions.<br/>
        This is what the <strong>chainArgs</strong> are used for that are defined per transformation.<br/>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>breakIfNotFound</li>
        <li>breakIfFound</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>breakIfNotFound</h5>
    <p>If set to true and the current transformation did not make any change, transformation chain is stopped</p>
    <h5>breakIfFound</h5>
    <p>If set to true and the current transformation did make a change, transformation chain is stopped</p>


    <h3>Transformations</h3>
    <p>
        Each transformation object contains two fields <strong>type</strong> and <strong>field</strong>.
        <br/>The type value indicates which type of transformation is represented.<br/>
        <br/>The field value indicates which part of the url is to be transformed.<br/>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <h4>URL fields</h4>
    <p>
        Defining the field name or the URL allows to restrict the scope of replacement which can be helpful.<br/>
        Here's a representation of a urls data so it gets clear which fields contains which data parts of the url.<br/>
        <br/>
        Sample url:
        <br/>
        <br/><strong>http://Username:Password@www.domain.sample:8090/index.html?q=1#h=2</strong>.
    </p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <pre>
    URL {
        hash: "#h=2",
        host: "www.domain.sample:8090",
        hostname: "www.domain.sample",
        href: "http://Username:Password@www.domain.sample:8090/index.html?q=1#h=2",
        origin: "http://www.domain.sample:8090",
        password: "Password",
        pathname: "/index.html",
        port: "8090",
        protocol: "http:",
        search: "?q=1",
        username: "Username",
    }
    </pre>

    <h3>Transformation Types</h3>
    <p><strong>Available types of transformations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>regExReplacement</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>RegEx Replacement</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>regEx</li>
        <li>replacement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>regEx</strong> stands for <strong>regular expression</strong> and is the tool to match a specific parts
        of the URL.<br/>
        In the example below the value is <strong>.*</strong> which means to select every character of the url.<br/>
        <br/>

        <strong>replacement</strong> holds the data that will replace the selected characters.<br/>
        The transformation would replace 'all characters' in 'href' with 'http://www.mydomain.com'<br/>
    </p>
    <h5>Example</h5>
    <pre>
        "transform": {
          "type": "regExReplacement",
          "field": "href",
          "regEx": ".*",
          "replacement": "http://www.mydomain.com"
        },
    </pre>

    <h5>Arguments</h5>
    <p>The replacement value can take arguments represented by placeholders eg.
        <strong>http://www.mydomain.$1</strong><br/>
        <strong>$1</strong> means to substitute the first argument that was given to the transformation.<br/>
        By this, replacements are parameterizable which makes it easy to define several actions that perform the same
        transformation, but with different data.<br/>
    </p>

    <h3>Test URLs</h3>
    <p>
        To check and see how your actions would work against some real urls you can define a list of testURLs.<br/>
        All Urls will be used to test all actions against.<br/>
        This is what you see on <a href="test.html">Test Page</a>.<br/>
